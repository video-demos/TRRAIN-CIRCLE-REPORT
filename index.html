    <h3>My contributions in the mobile app</h3>
    <p>I have developed a suite of innovative features for the app to enhance user engagement and streamline operations. Key features include an engaging <span class="highlight">reels section, in-app share, a robust YouTube-like video player for courses, seamless certificate generation and sharing</span>. Users can effortlessly share and repost content within the app, thanks to the in-app share functionality.</p>

    <p>Infinite scrolling has been integrated throughout the app, providing a fluid and continuous browsing experience.</p>
    <p>On the backend, I <span class="highlight">designed and implemented APIs</span> to support all app functionalities, ensuring reliable and efficient performance.</p>
    <p>Implemented <span class="highlight">event listeners</span> in the application using <span class="highlight">Clevertap</span> allowing admins to view statistics of user attention.</p>

    <p>In the second phase of the internship I <span class="highlight">improved the applicationâ€™s performance</span> significantly by memoizing components and functions wherever unnecessary rendering was occurring due to change in states.</p>

    <h3>My contributions in the Admin CMS</h3>
    <p>I have developed a Content Management System (CMS) for the mobile app from scratch, designed to empower the admins with the ability to efficiently update, add, delete, and manage the content displayed within the app.</p>
